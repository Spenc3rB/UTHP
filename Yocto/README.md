# Ultimate Truck Hacking Platform (UTHP) Yocto Build Guide

## 1: Introduction
### 1.1 Compatible Linux Distribution

Ensure your Build Host meets the following requirements:

- **Disk Space:** 50 Gbytes of free disk space.
- **OS:** Supported Linux distribution (i.e., recent releases of Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, Debian, or Ubuntu). I use Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. [You may also use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10 or 11.](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/start.html#setting-up-to-use-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2)

### 1.2 Required Software Versions

- Git 1.8.3.1 or greater.
- tar 1.28 or greater.
- Python 3.6.0 or greater.
- gcc 7.5 or greater.
- GNU make 4.0 or greater.

> **Note:** The Build Host is the system used to construct images in a Yocto Project Development environment.

## 2: Build Host Setup
### 2.1 Build Host Packages

Install the essential host packages on your build host:

```bash
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool
```

### 2.2 Clone Poky

```bash
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
```

Then move to the poky directory and take a look at existing branches:

```bash
cd poky
git branch -a
```

Check out the kirkstone branch:

```bash
git checkout -t origin/kirkstone -b my-kirkstone
```

### 2.3 Clone the UTHP Yocto Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SystemsCyber/UTHP
git checkout <desired-branch>
cd UTHP/Yocto
```

## 3: Building Your Image
### 3.1 Initialize the Build Environment

Run the oe-init-build-env environment setup script to define Yocto Projectâ€™s build environment on your build host. You need to be within the poky directory.

```bash
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env
```

This has to be done each time you open a new terminal to make changes to your Yocto system. The script also creates a build/ directory. Once the script is run, your current directory is the build directory. After the build completes, all files created during the build will be present in this directory.

### 3.2 Examine and Update Your Local Configuration File

Once the build environment is set up, a local configuration file named local.conf becomes available in a conf subdirectory of the Build Directory (i.e., poky/build/conf/local.conf). This file contains settings that control the behavior of the build system. You can modify this file to suit your needs.

For this example, our defaults are set to build for BeagleBone Black:

```bash
MACHINE ?= "beaglebone-yocto"
```

> TODO

For our build, we've added the following lines to the end of the local.conf file:

```bash
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "y"

MACHINE_HOSTNAME = "UTHP"

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " can-utils iproute2 libsocketcan custom_user"
```

> ENDTODO

The IMAGE_INSTALL variable is used to specify which packages to include in the image, and the append operator is used to add to the list of packages to be installed. Some of the image installs need to be added as a recipe, which will be discussed in [3.3 Adding Recipes to Your Build](#34-adding-recipes-to-your-build).

### 3.3 Adding Layers to Your Build
Yocto uses layers to manage additions to the base build. You can add your layer inside the build directory.

```bash
bitbake-layers create-layer meta-<your-layer-name>
```

Next, add this layer to your bblayers.conf

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-<your-layer-name>
```

For our build, make sure to copy the [meta-custom](meta-custom) layer to the build directory and add it to the bblayers.conf file with the following command:

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-custom
```

### 3.4 Adding Recipes to Your Build


Recipes are added inside your layers and follow a directory structure:

```
/poky
---/build
   ---/meta-<your-layer-name>
      ---/recipes-<recipe-name>
         ---/<recipe-name>
            ---/<recipe-name>.bb
```

You can refer to the [meta-skeleton](~/poky/meta-sekelton) layer for examples of how to create recipes. This example shows how to add a recipe for the can-utils package.

#### 3.4.1 This example shows how to add a recipe for the can-utils package:
> If you are following our build and have already copied the meta-custom layer to the build directory, you can [skip](#82-adding-a-custom-user) this section.

```bash
mkdir -p meta-custom/recipes-support/can-utils
```

```bash
recipetool create -o meta-custom/recipes-support/can-utils/can-utils_git.bb git://github.com/linux-can/can-utils.git
```

Edit can-utils.bb:

```bash
DESCRIPTION = "CAN utilities for Linux"
HOMEPAGE = "https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils"
SECTION = "utils"
LICENSE = "GPL-2.0"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=393a5ca445f6965873eca0259a17f833"

SRC_URI = "https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils.git;branch=master"
SRCREV = "186bd967173a8a42ff544b5977edcda7c968c1aa"

PV = "1.0+git${SRCPV}"

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

inherit cmake

# Override build directory if necessary
B = "${WORKDIR}/build"

do_configure() {
    cmake ${S} -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${D}
}

do_compile() {
    oe_runmake
}

do_install() {
    oe_runmake install
}

BBCLASSEXTEND = "native"
```

Include your recipe in conf/local.conf. Add the following line to include the recipe and its dependencies:

```bash
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " can-utils iproute2 libsocketcan"
```

Rebuild the image:

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

### 3.5 Adding a custom user

Under an layer add a recipe, example custom_user.bb:
> [Skip](#4-changing-the-kernel-device-tree) this section if you're following our build and have already copied the meta-custom layer to the build directory.

```bash
inherit extrausers

# Add default user 'uthp' and set the password
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "useradd uthp; \
                      usermod -p '\$5\$Nx2D0wB1k15\$LYl7n9Tvtwo0fmsbs/frfpm7OuDJj2AIvcdWZfhS99C' uthp; "
```

Ensure this recipe is added to the package to be baked in as follows:

```bash

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " custom_user"
```

## 4: Changing the Kernel Device Tree
### 4.1 Modifying the Kernel / Device Tree

> Note: Before making manual changes to the kernel, it is recommended to use the `bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel` command to open the kernel configuration GUI. This will allow you to make changes to the kernel in a more user-friendly manner. If you are following our build, you can [skip](#5-building-the-image) this section.

#### 4.1.2 Modifying the Kernel / Device Tree using menuconfig:

```bash
bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
```
To compile these changes for the build, run the following command:

```bash
bitbake virtual/kernel
```

#### 4.1.3 Modifying the Device Tree Manually as an example for adding D_CAN0 and D_CAN1:

Device Trees are data structures describing the hardware components for the kernel. To find the device tree for BeagleBone Black in the Yocto build:

```bash
find . -name "am335x-boneblack.dts"
```

This will return the path to the device tree file which you can modify manually located in `~/poky/build/tmp/work-shared`. 
> Make note of the includes at the top of the file. These are the files that are included in the device tree and may have other information that you might be looking for.

For adding D_CAN0 and D_CAN1, we need to disable `I2C2` and `UART1`. Never disable `UART0`:
```bash
&i2c2 {
    status = "disabled";
};

&uart1 {
    status = "disabled";
};

&am33xx_pinmux {
    dcan0_pins: pinmux_dcan0_pins {
        pinctrl-single,pins = <
            AM33XX_IOPAD(0x97C, PIN_INPUT_PULLUP | MUX_MODE2) /* P9_19: d_can0_rx */
            AM33XX_IOPAD(0x978, PIN_OUTPUT_PULLDOWN | MUX_MODE2) /* P9_20: d_can0_tx */
        >;
    };
};
&am33xx_pinmux {
    dcan1_pins: pinmux_dcan1_pins {
        pinctrl-single,pins = <
            AM33XX_IOPAD(0x984, PIN_INPUT_PULLUP | MUX_MODE2) /* P9_24: d_can1_rx */
            AM33XX_IOPAD(0x980, PIN_OUTPUT_PULLDOWN | MUX_MODE2) /* P9_26: d_can1_tx */
        >;
    };
};
&dcan0 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&dcan0_pins>;
    /* Other necessary properties and configurations */
};

&dcan1 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&dcan1_pins>;
    /* Other necessary properties and configurations */
};
```
Make sure to remove these lines as well from the DTS file:
- P9_20 (I2C2 SDA)
- P9_19 (I2C2 SCL)
- P9_26 (UART1 RXD)
- P9_24 (UART1 TXD)
  
Rebuild the Kernel:

```bash
bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
```

Add CAN driver support to the Kernel and bake the Kernel:

```bash
bitbake virtual/kernel
```

#### 4.1.4 Adding LED support via menuconfig as an example:

```bash
bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
```

- Device Drivers --> 
    - LED Support (enabled) --> 
        - LED Class Support (enabled) -- LED Support for GPIO connected LEDs (enabled) -- LED Trigger support (enabled) --> 
            - LED Heartbeat Trigger (enabled) -- LED CPU Trigger (enabled) -- LED GPIO activated Trigger (enabled) -- LED GPIO Trigger (enabled)

Rebuild the Kernel:

```bash
bitbake virtual/kernel
```

### 4.2 Copying the custom .config file to the kernel source directory:

```bash
find . -name ".config"
```

Copy the `.config` file to the kernel source directory and run `bitbake virtual/kernel -c compile -f` to compile the kernel.
```bash
cp ~/UTHP/Yocto/.config ~/poky/build/tmp/work-shared/beaglebone-yocto/kernel-build-artifacts
bitbake virtual/kernel -c compile -f
```

## 5: Building the Image

To build the image, run the following command:

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

## 6: Flashing the Image to an SD Card

The image for the BeagleBone Black will be present in tmp/deploy/images/beaglebone-yocto/.

```bash
dd if=core-image-minimal-beaglebone-yocto.wic of=/dev/sdb bs=4M
```
If you are on a Windows machine, you can use Etcher to flash the image to the SD card.

Connect the BeagleBone Black to your computer and power it up. You can use a serial terminal to connect to the BeagleBone Black. The default baud rate is 115200.

```bash
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

or on Windows using PuTTY.
Find the COM port by going to Device Manager and looking under Ports.

## FAQ  
### Nothing changed when using bitbake virtual/kernel:
Clean the Build: Try cleaning the build directory first:

```bash
bitbake -c cleansstate virtual/kernel
```

Force a Rebuild: Force Bitbake to rebuild the kernel even if it thinks it's up to date:

```bash
bitbake -c compile -f virtual/kernel
```

### How to verify Device Tree Overlays are working:

On the host system see the compiled device tree file, decompile it and check the changes are included:

```bash
sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler
```

```bash
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o am335x-boneblack.dts am335x-boneblack.dtb
```
